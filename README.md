## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Koriita0/Koriita0** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Desktop Apps
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my Minecraft GregTech world hahah
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what is my favorite color
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Kora or Korita

If you want to contact me for anything, feel free to ask.
